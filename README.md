See [here](https://youtu.be/aOADo7qGBds) for the first collegiate virtual comp!

## How to host your own!

1. Set up a system to receive video recordings from your competitors, titled like `999_Bronze_Latin.mp4`. Everything before the first underscore will be used as the competitor number, even if it contains non-digits.
1. Organize the music you want your competitors to dance to with a directory structure like
    + (root audio folder)
      + Bronze
        + Latin
          + any_file_name.mp3
        + Standard
          + music.mp4
      + Silver
        + Rhythm
          + ...

   and send the folder to your competitors to dance to. The filenames you use for the music doesn't matter: the first file found in the folder will be used as the true audio when stitching together all the videos.
1. Once you've received all your submissions titled in the form `999_Bronze_Latin.mp4`, run

   `python grid.py directory_with_submissions directory_with_music_you_sent_out output_directory`
   
   and watch the magic. You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed.
1. The code will strip all audio from dancer's videos, stitch them into grids, and overlay the original audio over all of them. The output directory will be structured like
    + (root output folder)
      + Latin
        + Newcomer
          + heat1.mp4
        + Silver
          + heat1.mp4
          + heat2.mp4
      + Rhythm
        + ...

   so the announcers can broadcast each one at their pace. See [https://youtu.be/aOADo7qGBds](https://youtu.be/aOADo7qGBds) for an example of a successful comp.
